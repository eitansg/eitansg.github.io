I am a postdoc at Princeton Politics (2025-2026), working with [John Kastellec](https://jkastellec.scholar.princeton.edu/) on topics in judicial politics. My research is in applications of economic theory (especially information design) and natural language processing to topics in political economy. 

I will join Purdue University's Mitch Daniels School of Business as an assistant professor in the MIS group in the 2026-2027 academic year. Previously, I received my PhD in economics from MIT in 2025 and my BA from Princeton University in 2019.
